# TownHub — Database Operations

Operational notes for schema changes and database connectivity.

---

## Schema changes (Drizzle push)

TownHub uses a push-based Drizzle workflow (no migration files in repo).

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push
```

### Before confirming a push

1. **Read the full SQL preview** Drizzle prints in the terminal.
2. **Reject destructive changes** unless you explicitly intend them:
   - `DROP TABLE` / `DROP COLUMN`
   - Enum value removals or renames
   - Type changes that rewrite columns
3. If you only expected additive changes (new indexes, new nullable columns), but Drizzle shows drops, **stop** and compare `lib/db/src/schema/` against the live database.
4. Use `push-force` **only in local development** when you understand the impact.

See also [docs/SETUP.md](SETUP.md) and [PRODUCTION.md](../PRODUCTION.md).

### Platform timezone column (`platform_settings.timezone`)

Additive column for the platform IANA timezone used for civil “today”, public hours, and mobile stop windows.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Column | `timezone text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'America/New_York'` |
| Existing rows | Receive `America/New_York` via the column default (or `COALESCE` if applying SQL by hand) |
| Rollout | After code ships that reads `timezone`, run `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` against the target database and confirm the preview shows only `ADD COLUMN` (no drops). Reject the push if unrelated destructive SQL appears. |
| Rollback | Safe to stop reading the column in app code; dropping the column is optional and should be a separate reviewed change |
| Notes | Do not hardcode a locality name into commerce/scheduling logic — keep the value as a configurable IANA zone. Invalid values are rejected on admin write; reads coerce invalid stored values to `America/New_York`. |

## Connection pool

The API (`@workspace/db`) uses `node-pg` with configurable pool settings. Defaults are suitable for local dev and a small beta deployment.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` | `10` | Maximum pooled connections per API process |
| `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Time to wait when acquiring a connection |
| `DATABASE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | How long idle clients stay open |
| `DATABASE_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Sets PostgreSQL `statement_timeout` on each new connection (`0` = disabled) |

### Production guidance

- Use an external pooler (PgBouncer, Neon, Supabase) when running multiple API instances.
- Set `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` conservatively so `(instances × pool max) + admin overhead` stays below PostgreSQL `max_connections`.
- Pool errors are logged as `[db] Unexpected idle client error on pool` or `[db] Failed to set statement_timeout on new connection`.

## Performance indexes

Secondary indexes for hot query paths live in `lib/db/src/schema/` via Drizzle `index()` definitions. After adding indexes, run `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` and confirm only `CREATE INDEX` statements appear.

## Business Hub live updates (SSE)

The API exposes `GET /api/businesses/:id/live-events` for authenticated owners/admins. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#business-hub-live-updates-sse) for the full design.

### Beta limitation (single instance)

Live events use an **in-process event bus** in `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/business-live-events.ts`. Publishing and SSE subscriptions must run in the same Node process. If you scale to multiple API replicas behind a load balancer, SSE clients will only receive events published on the instance they are connected to unless you add a shared bus (Redis pub/sub, Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, etc.).

### Polling fallback

The frontend keeps HTTP polling as a fallback when SSE cannot be established, and uses polling on all non-live Business Hub pages. Owner dashboard GETs (`/orders`, `/summary`, `/appointment-requests`, `/live-events`) are excluded from the general rate limiter so live dashboards do not hit 429 during normal use.

For owner-facing toast, banner, and tab/window behavior, see [BUSINESS_HUB_LIVE_NOTIFICATIONS.md](BUSINESS_HUB_LIVE_NOTIFICATIONS.md).

### Proxies

Ensure reverse proxies (nginx, Cloudflare, Replit) do not buffer `text/event-stream` responses. The API sets `X-Accel-Buffering: no` for nginx. If SSE fails only in a specific environment, check proxy buffering and timeout settings before disabling the feature.

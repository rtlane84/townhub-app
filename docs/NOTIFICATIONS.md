# Order Notifications

TownHub sends email and SMS notifications when meaningful **business events** happen during the order lifecycle — not when raw database status labels change internally.

Each notification answers:

- **What happened?**
- **What should the customer do** (if anything)?
- **What happens next?**

Notifications are fire-and-forget: they never block API responses. Delivery attempts are logged to `notification_logs` (viewable in **Admin → System Status**).

## Customer notification flow

### 1. Order received (first message)

**When it sends**


| Payment method              | Trigger                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Pay at pickup (`IN_PERSON`) | Immediately after `POST /api/orders`        |
| Card (`STRIPE`)             | After Stripe webhook marks the order `PAID` |


Card orders do **not** send this email on order create — only after payment is confirmed by the webhook. That avoids telling customers their order was received before they finish paying.

**Email**

- **Subject:** `We received your order`
- **Tone:** Thank you; the business has received the order and is reviewing it; another update will come when they accept it.
- **Includes:** Business name, order number, date/time, fulfillment method, items, total, **View Order** button.
- **Never uses** the word “confirmed” in this first message.

**SMS example**

```text
Clay Diner received your order #TH-20260629-ABC12. We'll notify you when it's accepted. https://yourdomain.com/order/42?token=<accessToken>
```

| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email subject | `Your order was cancelled`                                                                                                   |
| Email body    | Business cancelled the order                                                                                                 |

---

### Statuses that do **not** notify customers


| Status                    | Why                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEW`                     | Internal queue state; customer already got **Order received** |
| Unchanged status on PATCH | No duplicate notifications                                    |


---

## Business (owner) notifications

### New order

**Trigger:** Immediately after `POST /api/orders` (all payment methods)

**Email:** Branded HTML layout with:

- Heading: **New Order Received**
- Business logo (when configured)
- Order number, customer name, phone, email
- Payment method and payment status
- Fulfillment type, items, total
- **Open Order** button → business dashboard order detail

**SMS example**

```text
Clay Diner: New order #TH-20260629-ABC12
Alex · $24.50 · Paid
https://yourdomain.com/dashboard/business/orders/42
```

**Owner delivery settings** (Business Dashboard → Settings → Owner Notifications):


| Setting                  | Default | Effect                   |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------ |
| `notificationEmail`      | —       | Primary owner email      |
| `notificationPhone`      | —       | Owner SMS number (E.164) |
| `notifyNewOrdersByEmail` | `true`  | Email on new order       |
| `notifyNewOrdersBySms`   | `false` | SMS on new order         |


Email sends when the toggle is not `false` and an email is set. SMS sends only when the toggle is `true` and a phone is set.

### Appointment requests

Separate plain-text owner alerts for new appointment requests. See [RESEND_SETUP.md](./RESEND_SETUP.md) and [TWILIO_SETUP.md](./TWILIO_SETUP.md).

## Payment vs. notification timing

Payment status and notification content are intentionally separate:


| Concern                                    | Controlled by                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `paymentStatus = PAID`                     | Stripe webhook only (`checkout.session.completed`)                                                                      |
| “Order received” customer email/SMS (card) | Same webhook, after `PAID`                                                                                              |
| Success page copy                          | Frontend — “Payment received. Waiting for restaurant acceptance.” while `PENDING`; no false “paid” claim before webhook |


Pay-at-pickup orders skip Stripe entirely; customer notifications start on order create.

---

## Links and environments

All notification URLs are built from `APP_BASE_URL` — never hardcoded in templates.


| Audience                        | URL pattern                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer order page (signed-in) | `{APP_BASE_URL}/order/{orderId}`                     |
| Customer order page (guest)     | `{APP_BASE_URL}/order/{orderId}?token={accessToken}` |
| Business order detail           | `{APP_BASE_URL}/dashboard/business/orders/{orderId}` |


Set `APP_BASE_URL` per environment:

```bash
# Local
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:23032

# Staging
APP_BASE_URL=https://staging.yourtown.com

# Production
APP_BASE_URL=https://yourtown.com
```

If unset, the API falls back to `REPLIT_DOMAINS` or `http://localhost:5173` (code default). **Set `APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:23032` for local dev** so emails, SMS, and Stripe redirects use the correct host.

### Guest access tokens in notification links

Guest orders require a signed HMAC access token to view order details (see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)). The checkout confirmation page, Stripe success URL, and **customer order email/SMS links** include `?token=…` via `customerOrderUrlForNotification()`.

Signed-in customers who placed the order receive links **without** a token because `/order/{id}` matches their `customerUserId` when logged in. They can also use `/my-orders`.

---

## Email design

Customer and business order emails use shared HTML components:


| Component          | Purpose                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| TownHub header bar | Platform branding                     |
| Business logo      | Shown when `business.logoUrl` is set  |
| Status badge       | Visual lifecycle state                |
| Detail table       | Order metadata rows                   |
| Order items block  | Line items + total                    |
| Action button      | View Order / Open Order / Track Order |
| Footer             | “Powered by TownHub”                  |


Plain-text fallbacks are included for every HTML email. Resend receives both `text` and `html` bodies.

---

## SMS design principles

- **Short** — not a copy of the email
- **One idea per message** — what happened + link
- **Order link on every customer SMS** when phone is provided at checkout
- **Dashboard link on every business SMS** when owner SMS is enabled

Customer SMS requires `customerPhone` on the order. There is no separate customer SMS opt-in toggle today; if a phone number is collected at checkout, lifecycle SMS is sent alongside email.

### Lifecycle event mapping


| Order status           | Customer event           | Logged `eventType`       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| *(checkout / webhook)* | `ORDER_RECEIVED`         | `ORDER_RECEIVED`         |
| `CONFIRMED`            | `ORDER_ACCEPTED`         | `ORDER_ACCEPTED`         |
| `PREPARING`            | `ORDER_PREPARING`        | `ORDER_PREPARING`        |
| `READY_FOR_PICKUP`     | `ORDER_READY_FOR_PICKUP` | `ORDER_READY_FOR_PICKUP` |
| `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`     | `ORDER_OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` | `ORDER_OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` |
| `COMPLETED`            | `ORDER_COMPLETED`        | `ORDER_COMPLETED`        |
| `CANCELED`             | `ORDER_CANCELLED`        | `ORDER_CANCELLED`        |

## Provider setup


| Channel | Provider                   | Setup doc                            |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Email   | Resend (preferred) or SMTP | [RESEND_SETUP.md](./RESEND_SETUP.md) |
| SMS     | Twilio                     | [TWILIO_SETUP.md](./TWILIO_SETUP.md) |


When providers are not configured, notifications are still logged with status `LOGGED` so you can verify copy in **Admin → System Status** without sending real messages.

---

## Testing checklist

Verify each scenario in test mode with `APP_BASE_URL` set to your local or staging URL:

- [ ] Pay at pickup — customer gets **We received your order** immediately
- [ ] Stripe card — customer gets **We received your order** only after webhook marks `PAID`
- [ ] Guest checkout — confirmation page loads with `?token=` from order response
- [ ] Guest notification links — email/SMS include `?token=` for guest orders
- [ ] Signed-in customer — `/order/{id}` and `/my-orders` work without token
- [ ] Signed-in customer — same order link; **My Orders** available separately
- [ ] Pickup — ready-for-pickup email includes address/instructions
- [ ] Delivery — out-for-delivery email sends
- [ ] Cancelled card order that was paid — refund note appears
- [ ] Business new-order email — HTML layout, **Open Order** uses dashboard URL
- [ ] Business SMS — includes dashboard link
- [ ] Status `CONFIRMED` — says “accepted”, not “confirmed” in the first email (first email already sent earlier)
- [ ] No duplicate messages when status PATCH sends the same value

Run notification unit tests:

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run test
```
